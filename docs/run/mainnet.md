# Running ast on Amaze Chain Mainnet or Testnets


## Running the ast Node

Firstly, ensure that you have installed ast by following the installation instructions.

Now, to start the archive node, run:

```plaintext
ast 
```
At this point, our ast node has begun discovery and has even discovered some new nodes, and started syncing.


## Verify the chain is growing

You can easily verify this by inspecting the logs and seeing that headers are arriving in ast. Now sit back and wait for the stages to run! In the meantime, consider setting up observability to monitor your node's health or test the JSON RPC API.
